# Advanced-Product-Customer-Grouping-Analysis
This project demonstrates how to clean and summarize real-world sales data using Power Query in Excel. It groups products, counts how many times each product was purchased, and combines all customer names who bought that product into a single, comma-separated list — enabling clear and structured analysis for better business insights.
